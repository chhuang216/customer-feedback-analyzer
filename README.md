# Automated Customer Feedback Analyzer

![Demo GIF of the application](/gif/demo.gif)

This project is an end-to-end NLP application that analyzes customer reviews [(Amazon Fine Food Reviews - Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews?resource=download) to provide actionable business insights. It automatically discovers key topics, analyzes sentiment, and generates concise summaries from large volumes of text data.

### ## Problem Statement
Businesses often receive thousands of customer reviews, making it impossible to manually read and categorize them all. This leads to missed opportunities for improvement and a poor understanding of customer sentiment. This tool automates the feedback analysis pipeline to solve that problem.

---

### ## Features
- **Automated Topic Modeling:** Uses BERTopic to discover and visualize the main themes in customer feedback without needing pre-labeled data.
- **Abstractive Summarization:** Leverages a T5 Transformer model from Hugging Face to generate human-like summaries for reviews within each topic.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Performs sentiment analysis on reviews for each topic to quantify customer opinion.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit that allows for easy exploration of topics and insights.

### ## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Core Libraries:** Python, Pandas
- **NLP:** spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, BERTopic
- **Web App & Visualization:** Streamlit, Plotly
- **Environment:** Git, Virtual Environments
